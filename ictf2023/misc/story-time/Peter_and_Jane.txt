There once was a ship that put to sea
The name of the ship was the BIlly O' T3aaa
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down
Oh blow, my bully boys, blow {Fuh}

5oon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tongu1ng is done
We'll take our leave and go

5he'd not be3n two weeks from shore
When down on her a right whale bore
The Captain called all hands and swore
He'd take that whale in tow {Fuh}

5oon may the Wellerman come
To bring us sugar and tea and rum
One day, when the tongu1ng is done
We'll take our leave and go
